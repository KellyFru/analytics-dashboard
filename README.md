✅ Built with **Python**, **pandas**, **Streamlit**, and **Plotly**.  
✅ Hosted for free on **Streamlit Cloud** — so anyone can view the live demo.

  - CTR (Click-Through Rate)
  - CPC (Cost Per Click)
  - CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
  - Revenue & ROI
- **Visualizes KPIs:** Interactive bar charts, pie charts, and tables to help stakeholders:
  - Compare platforms by average CTR
  - See spend breakdown by platform
  - Analyze which campaigns deliver the best ROI
- **No database needed:** Data stays lightweight and deploys easily.
